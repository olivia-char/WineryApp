						<p>Overwhelmed by its natural beauty and mesmerized by its stunning mountain and vineyard vistas, we settled in Glen Ellen&rsquo;s Sonoma Valley Appellation in 1998. Soon after, we planted our Glenét Vineyards on our flowing valley property with rich Terre, excellent for growing high-quality wines destined to be fully accentuated by the ideal climate of Sonoma Valley&rsquo;s Viticulture Area.</p>

					<div className="aboutIntro">
						<p>In 2002, we planted our first two vineyards, a <i>Pinot Gris</i> block and our own unique red blend designate <i>Glenét Mélange,</i> which is a mixture of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon (three varietals) and 5% each of Petit Verdot, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Syrah.</p>
						<p>In 2016, we complimented our <i>Estate Pinot Gris</i> and <i>Glenét Mélange</i> varietals with a <i>Pinot Noir</i> whose fruit we source from neighboring vineyards, also within our Sonoma Valley Appellation.</p>

						<h1>The Cultivation of <b>Glenét Vineyards</b></h1>
						<p>We hand-craft each of our vintages to create the very best of what mother nature provides in this bucolic haven, capturing some of the best fruit from her earth and sunlight.</p>
						<p>Our <i>Pinot Gris, Glenét Mélange, and Pinot Noir</i> wines are tended from &ldquo;Bud Break&rdquo; to &ldquo;Harvest,&rdquo; organically grown and carefully groomed to generate robust fruit with outstanding tastes and flavors, clearly setting our wines apart from the agri-winery productions.</p>
						<p>To maintain this level of precision, our boutique wine case production results in just 25 to 100 cases per varietal per year. Though, it&rsquo;s just enough for our astute wine-loving Members.</p>
						<p>We are certain you&rsquo;ll consider Glenét Vinyard wines to be some of the finest available from Sonoma Valley Appellation. It&rsquo;s our privilege to share the beauty of Sonoma Valley and our bounty of wonderful wines with you!</p>
						<p>Cheers!</p>
